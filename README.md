# ðŸ‘» GhostFrame

> *An educational security research tool for demonstrating webcam permission phishing techniques.*

GhostFrame is a tool that captures images from
a target's front camera or webcam. It uses a fake website
hosted on an in-built PHP server and a tunneling service
like CloudFlared to create a masked, public link.
When the target clicks the link and allows camera permission,
GhostFrame grabs the cam shots remotely.
